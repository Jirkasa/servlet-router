                <p class="paragraph u-mb-4">Servlet router is simple and lightweight library for servlet routing. You can learn how to use it on this page. Czech version is available <a href="https://jirkasa.github.io/servlety-a-jsp-navod/dalsi-tutorialy/servlet-router/" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="benefits-of-using-servlet-router-library" class="heading-secondary u-mb-2">Benefits of using servlet router library</h2>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Mapping URLs to servlets via the web.xml file is not the best way to perform routing in a web application. If we have a lot of servlets, it becomes quite challenging to navigate in such a file. We always have to first define the servlet there, which takes up 4 lines of code, and then we have to map it to some URL, which also takes at least 4 lines of code. And that's not even considering filters, which also need to be defined and mapped in the web.xml file. Specifying the path in the url-pattern element for mapping a servlet or filter is not very user-friendly, and it's not always easy to map the servlet to the URL we want to. Furthermore, I don't think routing for a web application should be configured somewhere. It should be hardcoded in the application code (unless we're talking about some CMS system or similar, where the user might create their own pages). These are the main reasons that led me to create a routing library and thus avoid these problems.</p>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-1">The advantages of using the Servlet Router library are summarized in the following list:</p>
                <ul class="list u-mb-4">
                    <li>no clumsy URL mapping in the web.xml configuration file</li>
                    <li>just map one entry servlet for all requests, and routing depends on the application code itself (no need to configure the web.xml file intricately)</li>
                    <li>no use of filters</li>
                    <li>no confusing setting of URL patterns</li>
                    <li>support for path parameters</li>
                    <li>better code orientation (no need to struggle to figure out what is called for which URL)</li>
                    <li>easy implementation of the MVC architecture</li>
                    <li>built-in support for the HTTP PATCH method (the HttpServlet class does not support it by default)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="components" class="heading-secondary u-mb-2">Components</h2>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-4">The Servlet Router library contains three fundamental components: <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Router.html" target="_blank" class="link">Router</a>, <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Controller.html" target="_blank" class="link">Controller</a>, and <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Handler.html" target="_blank" class="link">Handler</a>. We will now take a look at each of them gradually, and you will also learn about other components built upon them.</p>
                <h3 id="router" class="heading-tertiary u-mb-1">Router</h3>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The Router is a component responsible for mapping controllers and handlers to specific paths. Its base class is <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Router.html" target="_blank" class="link">Router</a>. This class is abstract. It can be extended and used for routing any type of <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html" target="_blank" class="link">ServletRequest</a> and <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletResponse.html" target="_blank" class="link">ServletResponse</a> object. However, in 99.9 percent of cases, you will want to route <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpServletRequest</a> and <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpServletResponse</a> objects. In such cases, you can use <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/HttpRouter.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpRouter</a>.</p>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">You can create HttpRouter either directly and then map the corresponding controllers and handlers (which I do not recommend), or you can create a subclass and perform the mapping in the constructor. The following example demonstrates the first (not recommended) approach.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/create-http-router-directly-code-box.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The following example demonstrates a better way to create the router.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/create-http-router-subclass-code-box.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">As you may have noticed in the previous examples, the method used for mapping (registering) controllers or handlers is called register. If you look into the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Router.html" target="_blank" class="link">JavaDoc documentation</a>, you'll see that it's overloaded at least ten times. This is because it allows registering both controller and handler classes simultaneously. In Java, it's not straightforward to pass two different types as method parameters in a type-safe manner. So, I solved it by overloading the register method multiple times to make it more user-friendly and easier to use. This allows calling it with multiple handlers or controllers in succession, as shown in the following example. You'll find out why you might want to do this later on.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/register-method-examples-code-box.ejs") %>
                <h3 id="controller" class="heading-tertiary u-mb-1">Controller</h3>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Another fundamental component is the controller. Its task is to handle requests to a specific (usually) path. Similar to the router, the basic class here is the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Controller.html" target="_blank" class="link">Controller</a> class. However, you'll most often work with the HTTP protocol and process objects of type <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpServletRequest</a> and <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpServletResponse</a>. Therefore, you'll extend the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/HttpController.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpController</a> class for creating controllers. This class provides methods for handling requests sent using various methods (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.). The following example illustrates how a controller can look like.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/http-controller-example-code-box.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The following table illustrates various methods of the HttpController class that we can override to handle different types of requests.</p>

By default, an error page with status code 405 (Method Not Allowed) is sent for them. If instead we want to skip unimplemented methods and continue routing the request to other handlers/controllers, we can set the property <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/HttpController.html#skipUnimplementedMethods" target="_blank" class="link">skipUnimplementedMethods</a> to true, as shown in the following example.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">One thing you typically wouldn't do with traditional servlets is directly retrieve a parameter from the URL path. However, with the Servlet Router library, it's straightforward. You just need to define a parameter in the path during its registration in the router by using the ":" character followed by a name. Then, you can retrieve the parameter in the controller using the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Controller.html#getPathParam(java.lang.String)" target="_blank" class="link">getPathParam</a> method. The following example demonstrates this more clearly.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">A good practice is not to directly extend the HttpController class for creating controllers but to create your own base controller class.

Handlers are a similar component to controllers, as they also serve to process requests. The difference is that with controllers, we register the controller class in the router, whereas with handlers, we register an instance of the class.

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Middleware, like controllers, is used to process requests. However, it's typically employed just to perform some action on the request, and the routing of the request can continue. Middleware can be used, for example, to restrict access to selected controllers only for logged-in users, to set some attribute on the request, and so on. The base class is the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Middleware.html" target="_blank" class="link">Middleware</a> class, but in the vast majority of cases, you'll want to work with the HTTP protocol, so you can inherit from the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/HttpMiddleware.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpMiddleware</a> class when creating middleware.</p>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The following example illustrates an example of middleware that checks whether the user is logged in. If so, it allows the request to proceed; otherwise, it redirects the user to the login page.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/require-login-middleware-example-code-box.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Middleware is a handler and therefore implements the Handler interface. The setPathParams and matchesFullPath methods are already implemented for us. Storing parameters in the path is the same for every middleware, so it would be unnecessary to perform this in every middleware we create. Instead of retrieving parameters from the URL path, we can use the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Middleware.html#getPathParam(java.lang.String)" target="_blank" class="link">getPathParam</a> method. The matchesFullPath method is already implemented because, for most middleware, we want only the beginning of the request path to match. If this doesn't suit our needs, we can override the matchesFullPath method.</p>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The Servlet Router library provides a pre-built middleware that you'll likely want to register at the beginning of your application. It's called <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/BaseURLAttributeSetter.html" target="_blank" class="link">BaseURLAttributeSetter</a>. Its purpose is to set an attribute containing the root URL of your application into the request. Therefore, you don't need to use relative paths when setting paths to various assets in JSP pages, which prevents those JSP pages from being used for URLs with different lengths. The following example shows how to register this middleware. The default name for the attribute is "BASE_URL", but you can change it by passing a name into the constructor.</p>

You can register it using the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Router.html#registerErrorController(java.lang.Class)" target="_blank" class="link">registerErrorController</a> method. If an error controller is set for the router, it will be called when an exception occurs. Otherwise, the router will throw the exception instead.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">When using the Servlet Router library, you only need to create a single servlet, which you map for all incoming requests in the web.xml file. In this servlet, you typically call the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/Router.html#handle(Request,Response)" target="_blank" class="link">handle</a> method of an entry router of your web application when a request arrives for processing. The following example demonstrates how such a servlet might look.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">How to map a servlet to all incoming requests in the web.xml file is shown in the following example. Additionally, it's important to determine the name of the folder containing static assets such as CSS files, images, etc., located in the webapp directory, and map its path to the default servlet. When all requests are directed to the servlet, access to content in the webapp directory (except JSP files - unfortunately...) is blocked. This limitation frustrates me about JSP. Even though access to the webapp folder is blocked in this way, users can still access JSP files. Therefore, JSP files must be placed in the WEB-INF folder, where direct access is not allowed. The default servlet is used to access static resources, and most web servers have it. For Tomcat, this servlet is named "default".</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">You might want to see how to use the Servlet Router library in a project. Let's dive into creating a sample application. It will be a simple website with a main page, a page displaying a list of products, and a product detail page. The administrator will have the ability to add products and will be able to log in. The following diagram shows what the structure of the website will look like.</p>
                <img src="../../static/img/illustrations/ServletRouterExampleAppStructure.svg" alt="Structure of web application" class="image image--full-width u-mb-4">
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">We'll start by creating a new Maven project, which we can name "servlet-router-example-app." In the pom.xml file, we'll add the Servlet Router library to the project as a dependency, along with servlets, as shown in the following example.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/example-project-code-box-1.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The first thing we can do is to create the root router of our application. We can name it something like "AppRouter." For now, it will be empty, but at the beginning, we'll register the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/BaseURLAttributeSetter.html" target="_blank" class="link">BaseURLAttributeSetter</a> for setting the attribute containing the root URL of our application. We can create a Java package for it, perhaps named com.example.app.routes, and create it there.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Now we can create the entry servlet for our application (perhaps in the package com.example.app). When a request arrives for processing, we'll pass it to our root router using the handle method. We need to wrap the call to this method in a try-catch block. This ensures that if any error occurs in the router, we catch it. Later, we'll also create a custom error controller, so there may not be any exceptions thrown to this try-catch block. However, for safety, we'll return an error page using the sendError method, in case an error does reach this point.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">We'll map the created servlet for all incoming requests. In the webapp directory, we'll create a subdirectory named WEB-INF, and within it, a file named web.xml, where we'll map our servlet. The following example shows its content.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">We have the basic setup of the project ready. Now let's start creating the homepage. But before we do that, let's create our own basic controller class instead of directly inheriting from the <a href="./javadoc/io/github/jirkasa/servletrouter/HttpController.html" target="_blank" class="link">HttpController</a> class. This is a good practice because in this base class, we can define methods for code that we may frequently use in multiple controllers. Let's create an abstract base class for controllers, which we can name something like ExampleAppController. It will inherit from the HttpController class, and in our example, it will be empty. However, it doesn't matter, as the main point is that we'll have the ability to extend the base class for controllers at any time without modifying existing controllers. We can create it in the root package, perhaps com.example.app.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Now let's create the JSP page. In the WEB-INF directory (so that users cannot directly access JSP pages), we'll create a folder named jsp, and within it, a file named "HomePage.jsp". In the following example, you can view its code. The main page will simply display a welcome message and show a link to the product list page. You may notice that in the link, we're using the BASE_URL attribute, which is set by the BaseURLAttributeSetter middleware. This attribute contains the root URL of our application.</p>

                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">The first file included at the beginning will contain the code for the start of the page. Let's create it in a folder named includes, which we'll create, and name it "PageStart.jsp". Its content is shown in the following example.</p>

In this method, we will check if the entered credentials are correct, and if so, we will log in the user (by setting a session attribute). Otherwise, we will simply redirect them back to the main admin page where the login form will be displayed again (we are not handling any validation messages, etc., in our example).

                <%- include("./includes/example-project-code-box-39.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">We'll register the controller as the last one in our root router for all requests. So, if no other controller is found to handle the request during routing, this one will be used.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/example-project-code-box-40.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">If you now visit a URL that is not mapped to any controller, you should see the page displayed in the following image.</p>
                <img src="../../static/img/screenshots/ExampleAppPageNotFound.png" alt="Page not found" class="image image--full-width image--with-border u-mb-2">
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">We will now create an error controller, which will display an error page when an error occurs, and with that, we will consider our application complete. We will create it in the package "com.example.app.routes" and name it something like "ServerErrorController". In the handle method, we will simply print the error message to the console, set the HTTP status code to 500, and render a page announcing that an error has occurred. The code for the controller and the JSP page is shown in the following examples.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/example-project-code-box-41.ejs") %>
                <%- include("./includes/example-project-code-box-42.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Finally, we will register our error controller in the root router of our application using the registerErrorController method, as shown in the following example.</p>
                <%- include("./includes/example-project-code-box-43.ejs") %>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">If an error ever occurs in our application, the registered error controller should be called, printing the error to the console and displaying the error page. If you want to try it out, you can throw an exception in any controller.</p>
                <p class="paragraph u-mb-2">Our sample application is complete. If you want to review its code, you can open the left panel in the following demonstration and view individual project files.</p>
